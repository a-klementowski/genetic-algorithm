# genetic-algorithm
This repository contains a genetic algorithm implementation that can be used to solve optimization problems. 
The algorithm was developed using Java and is meant to be used as a starting point for further research and experimentation with genetic algorithms.
Project was developed as part of a university assignment for an Applied Computer Science course.

## Description

A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms. 
The algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. The population evolves toward better solutions over successive generations. 
The algorithm starts with a population of randomly generated individuals, and then it evaluates the fitness of each individual in the population. 
The fittest individuals are selected for reproduction, and their genetic material is combined to create offspring that inherit the characteristics of their parents. 
This process is repeated until a termination condition is met, such as reaching a maximum number of generations or finding a solution that satisfies certain constraints.

## Usage

The genetic algorithm implemented in this repository takes a set of parameters as input, such as population size, crossover and mutation probabilities, and the number of generations to run the algorithm for. These parameters can be adjusted by modifying the code in the Main.java file located in the src/Package_Main directory.
